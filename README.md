SURVEILLANCE AND CLASSIFICATION OF WILD ANIMALS USING IMAGE PROCESSING

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The population of India is growing quickly making it difficult to shelter everyone. In order to meet the necessities the majority of people live near forests due to their proximity to the forest people frequently interact with wild creatures. To protect humans wild animals are sometimes killed or human beings are attacked by animals.
Animals and human safety are equally vital. To ensure that both people and wild animals may live in safety, some sort of warning system must be put in place. There are several villages close to the forest, therefore there is a chance of people being harmed by wild animals.
To solve this situation we are going to create the solution of detecting wild animals using image processing and if it detects that animal is threat to people it will send signal to the frequency generator which will generate a frequency to scare away the wild animals.
